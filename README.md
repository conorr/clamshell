Command-line wrapper for Python modules
---------------------------------------

Consoll provides a command-line interface to your own Python modules. This may not sound like a big deal, since you can already import modules into Python's interactive console using the `-i` switch. The aim of Consoll, however, is to wrap your module in a command-line interface that is _indistinguishable_ from a full-blown terminal client, complete with command history and tab completion.

Here is an example:


```python
from consoll import Consoll

class Cat():

    def say_meow():
        print "meow"

    def add(a, b):
        print int(a) + int(b)

if __name__ == '__main__':

    c = Consoll(Cat)
    c.start()
```

Now, when you invoke this module in Bash, all of the methods of `Cat` are callable via a command-line:

    $ python cat.py
    >> say_meow
    meow
    >> add 2 3
    5
